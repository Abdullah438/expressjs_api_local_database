# ExpressJS-Local-Server

## This is an expressJS server that uses local json files to store and retrieve data

### It's totally up to you what data structure you want to use, you have to decide on post requests for both user and post

### When you decide to change structure, simply delete /json that will be created once you start the server

>Just run 'npm run dev' and enjoy
